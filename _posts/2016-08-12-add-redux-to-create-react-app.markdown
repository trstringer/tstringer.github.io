Facebook recently released an extremely cool tool to get up and running with React super quickly: [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html).  This is not only for beginners, but I've found that this can serve as great boilerplate for even seasoned React developers.  They gave a great way to give full control back to the developer by running the [eject script](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html#no-lock-in).

With that being said, I was interested to inject a basic implemenation of Redux into this out-of-the-box app created by create-react-app.  [I did just that](https://github.com/tstringer/create-react-app-with-redux).

The repository consists of only two commits.  The first commit is the out-of-the-box app generated by create-react-app (and then subsequently ejected by running `npm run eject`).  And [the second commit](https://github.com/tstringer/create-react-app-with-redux/commit/74332c2a5b96af69750c7ebcec3c5e8b5e53270b) is the simple code that adds a basic Redux implementation to this app.  It doesn't do anything fancy, just allows adding people names to the Redux store and displaying that data in the React app.

Check it out, I know I'll be using it as a quick reference to adding Redux to this implementation.  create-react-app is a great way to generate the boilerplate, highly recommended!

Enjoy!
