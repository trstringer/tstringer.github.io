Thomas is a SQL Server Senior Support Escalation Engineer at Microsoft.  He can also be found working with a large variety of technologies, such as .NET all the way to node.js.  Thomas enjoys relational data (SQL Server and MySQL) as well as unstructured (MongoDB and DocumentDB).  He is always looking for the right tool for the right job, even if it's a completely different stack.  He also believes that the cloud is the 99% solution.

When he isn't working on a computer, Thomas can be found hanging out with his two children, surfing, or playing ragtime piano.
